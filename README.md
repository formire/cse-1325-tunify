# Tunify 

## Project idea: 

The Java project we’re designing is a music streaming app. We’re retrieving data from Spotify using Spotify API. This will give us access to artists, albums, songs, podcasts, and other materials available on Spotify. Users will be able to look up songs, create and manage playlists, and view queue.
